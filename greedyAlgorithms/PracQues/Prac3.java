 *******Lexicographically smallest string of length N and sum K********

 We have two integers N and K. The task is to print the lexicographically smallest string of
 length N consisting of lower-case English alphabets such that the sum of the characters of
 the string equals to K where ‘a’ = 1, ‘b’ = 2, ‘c’ = 3, ….. and ‘z’ = 26.

 Sample Input 1 : N = 5, K = 42
 Sample Output 1 : aamz
 
 Sample Input 2 : N = 3, K = 25
 Sample Output 2 : aaw

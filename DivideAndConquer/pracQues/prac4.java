//Given an array nums of size n, returnthe majority element.(MEDIUM)
//The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.
//You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
//Sample Input 1: nums = [3,2,3]
//Sample Output 1: 3
//Sample Input 2: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
//Sample Output 2: 2
//Constraints(extra Conditions):
//●n == nums.length
//●1 <= n <= 5 * 104
//●-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

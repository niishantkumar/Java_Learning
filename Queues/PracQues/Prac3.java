/*
 We have an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and associated profit if the job is
 finished before the deadline. It is also given that every job takes a single unit of time, so the
 minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. Maximize the total profit if only one job can be
 scheduled at a time.

 Sample Input 1 :
 JobID  Deadline  Profit
   a       4        20
   b       1        10
   c       1        40
   d       1        30
   
 Sample Output 1 : c, a

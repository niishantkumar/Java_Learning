 *********Reversing the first K elements of a Queue************

 We have an integer k and a queue of integers, we need to reverse the order of the first k
 elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order.
 Sample Input 1 : Q = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100] ,k=5
 Sample Output 1 : Q = [50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
